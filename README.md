# SmartMed-Guardian
AI-enabled Treatment Compliance &amp; Safety System
## System Architecture

The system follows a simple three-layer architecture to ensure safety, privacy, and reliability.

### 1. Input Layer
- Mobile or Web Application
- Medication schedule input
- Manual or QR-based intake confirmation

### 2. Processing Layer
- Rule-based logic to detect:
  - Missed doses
  - Incorrect timing
  - Repeated non-compliance
- Edge AI / TinyML (planned for future phases) to enhance validation while preserving privacy

### 3. Output Layer
- Real-time alerts to patients
- Caregiver notifications
- Daily and weekly compliance reports
